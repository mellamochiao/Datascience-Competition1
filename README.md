# Data Science CP1 Competition Project

##  Task Overview
This is the course competition project for "Introduction to Data Science".  
The goal is to perform **binary classification** on 49 different datasets using various machine learning models.

## Project Structure
**`model/`**  
  Contains all the `.ipynb` notebooks for model training and experimentation:
  - `knn.ipynb`
  - `logistic_regression.ipynb`
  - `random_forest.ipynb`
  - `xgboost.ipynb`
  - `LightGBM.ipynb`
  - `stacking.ipynb`

**`CP1report.pdf`**  
  Final report including:
  - Data insights and analysis
  - Model comparisons
  - Hyperparameter explanation
  - Leaderboard performance


## Selected Best Models
In our final report, we focus on the three best-performing models (Based on Performance) :
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Logistic Regression**
These models were selected based on their public leaderboard performance and stability across datasets.


##  Methods Used
- Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest
- Advanced models: XGBoost, LightGBM
- Ensemble: Stacking
